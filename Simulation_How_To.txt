This file documents how to set up the simulation environment.

Assumptions:
- You have a virtual machine set up running Ubuntu 18.04
- You have MATLAB installed on the machine running the virtual machine

1) Install ROS (Gazebo 9 comes with the installation) and set up your workspace per the link: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
2) Install ros_control and ros_controllers per the link (step 7): http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control
3) Install bazebo_ros_pkgs: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros
4) Add the following lines to the end of .bashrc (a hidden file in your Home folder).  The first line is one you would have to run in the terminal if not included here.  The second two allow MATLAB and the ROS nodes on the virtual machine to communicate.  Otherwise they would use a short hand notation when initialized that the other won't recognize.
   source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
   export ROS_IP=(Insert the virual machine IP Address)
   export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://(Insert the virtual machine IP Address:11311
5) Add the following line to the end of .profile (another hidden file in your Home folder).  This line is necessary to allow Gazebo to run at ~60 frames per second, vice 4.
   export SVGA_VGPU10=0
6) Copy the rbe550_semi_... folders from github into the ~/catkin_ws/src folder.
7) Copy the Semi_Start.sh file to your Home directory.
8) Run the following command to allow the Semi_Start.sh file to be executed.
   chmod +x ./Semi_Start.sh
9) You can now Run the Semi Truck by typing the below command in a terminal:
   ./Semi_Start.sh
